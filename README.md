# Movie-Correlation-Python-Project
## Overview

This project involves Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and data cleaning of a movie dataset. The primary goal is to analyze the dataset and uncover correlations between various attributes, with a focus on exploring the relationships between budget, gross revenue, movie production companies, and viewer votes.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project contains information about movies, including details such as movie name, rating, genre, year of release, budget, gross revenue, production company, and viewer votes.

## Correlation Analysis

The central objective of this project was to identify correlations between the following variables:

- Budget and Gross Revenue: Assessing whether there exists a correlation between the budget invested in a movie and its gross revenue.
- Gross Revenue and Production Company: Investigating whether the production company influences the gross revenue of a movie.
- Gross Revenue and Viewer Votes: Exploring the relationship between viewer votes and the gross revenue of a movie.

Correlation analysis was conducted to quantify the strength and direction of these relationships.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, this project provides valuable insights into budget, gross revenue, production companies, and viewer votes within the movie industry. The process of EDA and data cleaning played a crucial role in ensuring the accuracy of our analysis, ultimately revealing significant correlations that can inform industry strategies.
